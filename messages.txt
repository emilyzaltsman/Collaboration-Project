I like dogs more than cats!
I have to disagree! But I do also love dogs. I have 4
I am more of a cat person even though my cat is mean to me
What does your cat do to you?
Your cat is mean. And signficantly larger than she was a year ago. I have 4 dogs: Harris, Delilah, Jake, and Bety. I also have 4 cats: Angus, Uma, Wolfgang, and Storm. 
Yeah, my cat is really fat now. Also Delilah is adorable I love her
I have two dogs named Smokey and Nina. My cat is named Andre but he hates us.
I love animals. They are wonderful and so cute. 
I am not going to come to school tomorrow because I am sick, but if either of you text me saying that we have to do a group thing, I will try to do it from home!
